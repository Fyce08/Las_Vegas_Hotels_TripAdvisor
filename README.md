## Detailed Analysis

**Total Users by Continent:** North America dominates with 295 users, followed by Europe with 118 users. Other continents like Oceania, Asia, South America, and Africa have significantly fewer users (41, 36, 7, and 7 respectively).

**Top 10 Hotels by Total Rooms:** The Venetian Las Vegas Hotel leads with 4,027 rooms, followed closely by Excalibur Hotel & Casino with 3,981 rooms and Bellagio Las Vegas hotel wth 3,933 rooms.

**Traveler Type:** Couples make up the largest traveler type with 214 users, followed by Families with 110 users, Friends with 82 users, and Business travelers with 74 users. Solo travelers represent a smaller segment of just 24 users, indicating that most trips are group-oriented.

**Users by Period of Stay:** User visits are fairly balanced across the year, with the highest number of users visiting from March to May (128) and the lowest from December to February (124). Seasonal distribution suggests consistent demand throughout the year, with no drastic seasonal peaks.

**Total Number of Hotels by Star Rating:** The majority of hotels are rated 5 stars (8 hotels), followed by 4-star (5 hotels) and 3-star (4 hotels) accommodations. This distribution highlights a preference or higher availability of luxury (5-star) hotels.

**Total Hotels by Additional Services:** The largest group (13 hotels) offer amenities including free Wi-Fi, clubs, and exercise rooms but no basketball courts. Only four hotels offer a full suite of amenities (Free Wi-Fi, Exercise Room, Club, and Basketball Court), indicating that most of the hotels do not have basketball courts.

## Conclusion

The dashboard reflects that Tripadvisor hotel users in Las Vegas between Decmeber 2020 to November 2021 predominantly came from North America, with a notable presence from Europe. The majority of users travel as couples and the demand is spread relatively evenly across different seasons. The hotels analysed are largely in the luxury segment, focusing on essential amenities like Wi-Fi, clubs, and exercise rooms.


## Recommendations

**Expand Amenities:** The Hotels could consider adding amenities like clubs and basketball courts, especially for properties attracting families and group travelers.

**Marketing Focus for Africa and South America:** Given the lower user base from Africa and South America, Tripadvisor may focus on marketing in these regions to boost interest.

**Seasonal Offers for Couples and Families:** Tailored seasonal promotions for couples and families could help maximise occupancy rates in lower-demand periods.

**Highlight Proximity to Attractions:** Emphasise the central location of these hotels on the Strip to attract tourists looking for a convenient and immersive Las Vegas experience.
